"""Write the golden Iceberg tables the layout tests read.

One contract-shaped table per key type, one more in table format version 3,
the off-contract layouts whose serving cost RFD 007 prices and whose
findings RFD 016 reports, and contract tables Spark then changes with
merge-on-read (RFD 021): position deletes in format version 2, deletion
vectors in version 3, and ordered tables (RFD 025): many rows per key,
each with an order value, written by appends, skew-split writes, a MERGE,
and a sorting compaction. The reference group, written only when --only
names it, holds ordered tables near a production table's size: about 20
million rows each, about 9 GB together. Run it against any object store
or local directory; the tests locate the result through
ICETRAY_GOLDEN_WAREHOUSE.

    pip install 'pyspark==4.1.*'
    python3 dev/golden-tables.py --warehouse s3a://bucket/prefix/warehouse
    python3 dev/golden-tables.py --warehouse file:///tmp/icetray-golden
    python3 dev/golden-tables.py --only long_2m --warehouse file:///tmp/icetray-golden
    python3 dev/golden-tables.py --only reference --reference-keys 20000 --warehouse file:///tmp/icetray-golden

Without Spark on the host, dev/golden-tables.sh runs this script with Spark in
a container against a warehouse under target/.

Needs Spark 4.1 (Java 17 or later) with the Iceberg runtime on its classpath;
--packages adds it from Maven when it is absent. 4.1 is the newest Spark line
Iceberg 1.11 ships a runtime for, and the runtime's Scala suffix (2.13) must
match the Spark build's. A Hadoop catalog is used so that a table root
and its version hint are the only handles a reader needs, with no catalog
service to run.

Keys are spaced by three, so key + 1 is always absent and inside the table's
key range: that is the miss a test wants. Values are a function of the key, so
an answer is checkable without a stored oracle; in a table merge-on-read
changes, of the key and the version that wrote it (RFD 014), so a lookup
that answered from a deleted copy is told apart from one that answered from
the live row.

What this script cannot write, and the in-process writer does instead: a
column of Iceberg's own `uuid` type (Spark SQL has no UUID type to declare),
an unsorted file, a null key, a key column whose physical type contradicts
the schema, and an equality delete, which Spark's row-level commands never
write.
