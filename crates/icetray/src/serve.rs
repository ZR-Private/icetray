//! The daemon (RFD 012, RFD 005): both listeners bound and the health
//! service registered before any table loads, every table loaded
//! concurrently, readiness and `SERVING` once every table serves, one
//! refresh task per table and the recorder's upkeep on the poll interval, a
//! sample of the page cache's hold on the chunk files on its own interval, the
//! configuration followed when the run was given one to follow (RFD 018),
//! and a drain on shutdown that ends health watches, waits up to the drain
//! deadline for in-flight calls, and flushes the page cache's disk level.
//! A first-load failure keeps health `NOT_SERVING` for a grace period, so
//! an orchestrator's probe sees it, then ends the run; a periodic task that
//! panics ends the run at once, with the task named.
