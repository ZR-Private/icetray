//! The doctor (RFD 007, RFD 016, RFD 020, RFD 021, RFD 022): the finding
//! codes, the levels they cap, penalties, and thresholds by which a table
//! is classified, applied identically at every load and in the `doctor`
//! subcommand. A value-column finding is made per column and names it, and
//! each column has a level of its own; the table's level is the dearest
//! column's. `diagnose` is a pure function of a loaded `Generation` and
//! the table's declared level: it reads the footers, page indexes, fences,
//! manifest entries, and applied delete state the generation holds and
//! nothing else, so the same generation always gets the same report.
