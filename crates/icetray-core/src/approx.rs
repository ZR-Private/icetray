//! Integer-to-float conversions for reporting, and the conversions between
//! the `usize` of an in-memory length and the `u64` of a byte or row total.
//! Ratios and gauge values are approximate by nature, and this module is the
//! one place that conversion happens, so a call site says what the float is
//! for. Identifiers never become floats: a 63-bit id loses its low digits in
//! an `f64`, so ids go in metric labels and log fields instead.
//!
//! The crate builds only for targets whose `usize` is 64 bits, which the
//! assertion below enforces at compile time, so `count` and `length` are
//! exact both ways and neither saturates nor fails.
