//! `PLAIN` byte-array pages read in place: a `BYTE_ARRAY` column chunk of
//! `PLAIN` data pages and no dictionary page, neither nested nor repeated.
//! Each page is fetched and decompressed as for parquet's column reader
//! (`ChunkPages`), and its values are sliced from the decompressed page,
//! each a length prefix and the bytes it counts, so a value read costs no
//! allocation and no reference count. Two readers share the format: the
//! one `verify` checks the common key column with at load
//! (`checked_run`), whose values must all be present, and the one a Scan
//! and a lookup read value rows with (`value_rows`), nulls among them,
//! whose rows before the first asked for are passed over by walking their
//! length prefixes. A chunk of any other shape, and a chunk holding any
//! page a reader cannot read exactly, is left whole to the column reader,
//! which reads it as it reads every other chunk: each reader decodes
//! exactly the values the column reader decodes, from exactly the pages
//! the offset index names, or decodes none of them.
