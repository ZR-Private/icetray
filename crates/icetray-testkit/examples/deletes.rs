//! The merge-on-read measurements, a program and not a test: the three
//! measurements RFD 021 (Merge-on-read) makes before release, over
//! contract-layout tables of long keys that the fixture writer builds under
//! `--work-dir`, served in process through `Table` over `Storage`'s
//! `file://` store, so no gRPC and no object-store latency is in them.
//!
//! - `probe`: hit and miss latency at each of `--depths` files per bucket in
//!   each residency tier, over three tables grown one overlapping file per
//!   commit (`Variant`). Every key is asked once unmeasured first, so the
//!   page cache and the kernel's hold what the measured lookups read. In
//!   the Full tier the two steps of each probe are then timed apart over
//!   the same lookups (`micro`): the key-page decode, through
//!   `FileIndex::page_of`, and the deleted-row check, over each file's
//!   deleted rows built as a generation builds them (`served_rows`),
//!   against RFD 021's threshold of a tenth of a decode.
//! - `memory`: the delete state's bytes against the bound the budget counts
//!   for it, at each of `--deleted-per-mille`, in each delete form and
//!   pattern, with the deleted-row check's time over each state.
//! - `load`: a first load with each of `--delete-files` live delete files,
//!   and a refresh onto the snapshot with one more, timed, with their GETs.
//!
//! Results print as tables and are written as JSON under `--out-dir`. Run
//! with `cargo run -p icetray-testkit --example deletes --release -- --help`.
