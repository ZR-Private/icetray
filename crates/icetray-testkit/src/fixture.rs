//! Fixture tables written with the Iceberg library's own writer (RFD 014):
//! a `bucket(N, key)`-partitioned, key-sorted table in the serving layout of
//! RFD 002, or in any layout a test names through `Layout`. Values are a
//! function of the key and of the version that wrote it, so any answer is
//! checkable without a stored oracle, and a live row is told apart from a
//! deleted copy of its key.
//! An ordered fixture (RFD 025) writes many rows per key, sorted by key and
//! then order value, and tracks each row by its id and order value.
//! What the library's writer cannot produce (a delete file, a dropped data
//! file, a null key, a key column whose Parquet type contradicts the schema)
//! is committed as a raw file or as a snapshot written by hand.
